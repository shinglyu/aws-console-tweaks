AWS Console Tweaks
----------

AWS Console has a lot of missing features and bad UI design. This browser extension makes tweaks to it to make the console more useable.

## Features:
* Add a copy button next to S3 bucket names
* Add a copy button next to S3 file path breadcrumbs

You can install it directly on Chrome Web Store: [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amdncfaligiipffldgnhomecghokodke/)
